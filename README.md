# BoltCipher
A new cipher method that I have developed. It uses base 2 and modulo

# Method
This is the algorithm, agnostic to the language

# Encryption
Plaintext --> Convert to characters --> Get index of characters --> Split index by digits --> sum 2^ (each digit) --> new index --> new character

# Decryption
The reverse. However, I'm not sure how to go about this just yet as it seems to be one-way.
